# Intro
This is graphing tool that can plot data from csv files. This tool was intially designed for Daimler Trucks North America as our capstone project to help their data engineers analyze kinematics data. Kinematics data is data that describes how components in a vehicle move when the vehicle is operational. 

# Running the Program 
To run the program run kinneyoutstart.py. You can also run python -m streamlit run kinneyout.py in the terminal. This will open up a tab in your default web browser that is hosted on local host. You will be promted to enter enter a csv file. The program can take multiple csv files. 

# Graphing 
You can select any two rows in any of the csv files that are selected as input for the program. Any row can make up all the x values and any row can make up all the y values. The user can have up to 5 graphs at a time. The user can download any graph that plot. 
 
# Standard Plots
If all the artic, lateral, and parallel csv file are inputed in the website then the user can display the standard plots of a vehicle. The standard plots are preset directions for graphing info about a vehicle. The directions can be found on a csv file that we can not put on this repo because of privacy issues with Daimler. 

# Customizing Graphs
The user can customize the graphs in a number of ways. Once a graph is plotted they can edit they y and x axis offset. They can also edit the y and x axis range. They can also change the color of the graph as well as show multiple quadrants. The user can also get the linear value of the plots as well.

# Dataset Manipulation
 The user can also make new rows with our math operations. The user can add,subtract,divide,average, and multiply rows in the csv files element wise.
